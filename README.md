This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in C#: accessing a property before it's been assigned a value within a class's constructor.  The `bug.cs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.cs` provides a corrected version.  This is a frequent source of unexpected null reference exceptions or default value usage, particularly in more complex object initialization scenarios.  Understanding how property initialization works in constructors is essential for writing robust and predictable C# code.
